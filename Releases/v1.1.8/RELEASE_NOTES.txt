NDI Output Plugin v1.1.8 - Added Metal GPU Acceleration

Features:
- Real Metal GPU acceleration for RGBA to UYVY conversion
- Metal GPU acceleration for HDR frame processing  
- Automatic fallback to CPU if Metal fails
- Improved performance on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs with Metal support
- Version display label in plugin interface

GPU Acceleration:
- Uses Metal compute shaders for color space conversion
- Parallel processing on GPU for better performance
- Optimized for both SDR and HDR workflows
- Significant performance improvement over CPU-only processing

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed NDI source not activating until HDR checkbox was checked
- Fixed HDR mode sending black frames
- Improved parameter handling and NDI initialization

Technical Details:
- Metal compute kernels for RGBA to UYVY conversion
- GPU-accelerated HDR 16-bit conversion
- Proper vertical flip handling in GPU shaders
- Thread-safe GPU context management
- Automatic Metal availability detection
