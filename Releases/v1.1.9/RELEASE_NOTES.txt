🎯 HOW TO VERIFY GPU ACCELERATION:
1. Check plugin version shows "GPU-Accelerated NDI Advanced"
2. Monitor Console.app for "NDI Plugin" messages
3. Look for "✅ Metal GPU acceleration SUCCESS!" logs
4. Verify timing shows <5ms for 1080p conversions
5. Use included monitoring script: ./monitor_gpu_performance.sh

🔧 DEBUGGING FEATURES:
- Detailed error messages for Metal initialization failures
- GPU context availability logging
- Metal device information logging
- Shader compilation error reporting
- Performance bottleneck identification

This release provides complete transparency into GPU acceleration performance,
making it easy to verify that Metal GPU acceleration is working optimally
and providing detailed diagnostics for troubleshooting any issues.
